			<h2>Use Case - Shawn</h2>
			<p>Shawn is working from home on a Tuesday afternoon. She is going to take a long lunch because she is overwhelmed from work and her boss' pressure. She's planning on taking her dog Finn on a walk. She is also dog sitting her roommate's dog Kota. She plans on taking the two of them to a local dog park in Phoenix, AZ. She goes to our website, and she logs into Finn's profile. She pulls up her list of favorite parks, and checks the visitor schedule. She notices there is a lab and a few mid size mixed breed dogs scheduled to be there within the next half hour. She packs some treats, water bowls, and she heads out with Finn and Kota for a fun adventure with new friends. While at the park, she opens our app and checks into the park, and she gets a check-in badge.</p>
			<h2>Use Case - Danesha</h2>
			<p>Danesha is in a work meeting on Friday at 11:30AM. Her boss tells her she can take the remainder of the day off. Before getting in her car to sit in lunch hour traffic, Danesha goes to our site and sees there is a really nice park near her office. Her roommate is watching her dog, so she asks her to meet her at this newly listed park with Oreo. Danesha meets a woman named Heather and her beagle Tom at the park this day. Heather isn't familiar with our website, so Danesha shows her how to sign up.</p>
				<ol>
				<li>Heather pulls up our website on her Samsung Galaxy S6.</li>
				<li>She creates a profile for herself and Tom.</li>
				<li>She then finds Danesha's profile and requests a connection, so they can schedule Paw Dates.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>Use Case - MJ</h2>
			<p>Michael Jordan logged into the site using his Dell laptop. He logged in by submitting a form. The site redirects him to his personalized feed from the Profile entity which brings up his profile. He searches the park location on the site to make sure he knows how to get there since
				he will be leaving from a friends house. He clicks on the "Schedule" button which brings up a calendar and he schedules a future date to visit the dog park that matches up with one of his doggie park friends. After this is complete, the site alerts him that his puppy date has
				been scheduled.</p>
